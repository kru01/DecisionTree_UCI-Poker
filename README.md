# Decision Tree with UCI Poker and scikit-learn

- Lab homework from HCMUS's 2023 Introduction to AI course.

## Content

- `...Lab02.pdf` contains all the tasks and requirements of the project.
- `LabReport.pdf` includes my documentation for some concepts and all the required tasks.
- The notebook itself is already very intuitive so you can just skip straight to it.
- The purpose of every folder is explained in the section of the notebook that it is used.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Any IDE, preferably VSCode.
- Python 3.11 and Jupyter package.
  - Alternatively, the `.ipynb` file can be run on Google Colab.
- All libraries from the `Import library` section of the notebook.

### Installation

- Clone the repo.

## Usage

- **Make sure `Import Library` is run at least once.**
- The notebook is written in a way that each task is stand-alone. So long as all libraries are imported, it is not obligated to run through every code block sequentially.
